This project predicts solar power generation using linear regression. The dataset is loaded and processed using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization. The goal is to create an accurate model for forecasting solar energy output based on factors like weather, time of day, and location.
